# Task List Project

This is the first project of Brad Traversy's "Modern JavaScript From The Beginning" course on Udemy. I incorporated a more organized CSS architecture than was provided in the course, including SASS, modular CSS files, BEM methodology (I did not want to use Materialize, which is what Brad used for the project). Aside from this, I mostly replicated the project exactly as instructed, though I opted to use Gulp and Webpack for various tasks.
